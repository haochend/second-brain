# Memory Consolidation System - Implementation Guide

## üéâ Implementation Complete!

The memory consolidation and knowledge synthesis system from your design document has been fully implemented. Everything runs automatically in the background - no manual triggers needed!

## üèóÔ∏è What Was Built

### 1. **Enhanced Background Processor** (`src/memory/processing/enhanced_processor.py`)
- Processes memories with full semantic context
- Automatically detects tasks and actionable items
- Builds relationships between memories
- Identifies task completions and updates

### 2. **Daily Consolidator** (`src/memory/consolidation/daily.py`)
- Runs automatically at 2 AM every night
- Consolidates the previous day's memories into insights
- Extracts decisions, topics, emotional patterns, and completed tasks
- Generates a narrative summary of the day
- Calculates importance scores

### 3. **Weekly Pattern Recognizer** (`src/memory/consolidation/weekly.py`)
- Runs every Sunday at 3 AM
- Identifies recurring themes and patterns
- Analyzes productivity, collaboration, and decision patterns
- Detects stress triggers and success patterns
- Generates actionable recommendations

### 4. **Knowledge Synthesizer** (`src/memory/consolidation/knowledge.py`)
- Runs monthly on the 1st at 4 AM
- Clusters related memories semantically
- Creates knowledge nodes from coherent themes
- Builds a knowledge graph with relationships
- Extracts wisdom and principles quarterly

### 5. **Background Service Scheduler** (`src/memory/service/scheduler.py`)
- Orchestrates all consolidation tasks
- Runs queue processing every 5 minutes
- Handles all scheduled consolidation tasks
- Provides graceful shutdown and error recovery

### 6. **Enhanced Query Interface** (`src/memory/query/enhanced_search.py`)
- Intelligently routes queries to appropriate memory levels
- Supports multiple query types (tasks, patterns, wisdom, etc.)
- Provides federated search across all consolidation layers
- Offers context-aware suggestions

## üì¶ Installation Requirements

```bash
# Install additional dependencies
pip install schedule scikit-learn
```

## üöÄ Getting Started

### 1. Test the Pipeline

Run the test script to verify everything is working:

```bash
python test_consolidation.py
```

This will test all components of the consolidation pipeline.

### 2. Install the Background Service

The service runs continuously in the background, processing memories and running consolidations:

```bash
# Make scripts executable (if not already)
chmod +x scripts/*.sh

# Install and start the service
./scripts/service-control.sh install
```

### 3. Check Service Status

```bash
# View service status
./scripts/service-control.sh status

# Follow live logs
./scripts/service-control.sh logs
```

## ‚è∞ Automatic Schedule

Once installed, the service runs everything automatically:

| Task | Frequency | Time | Purpose |
|------|-----------|------|---------|
| **Queue Processing** | Every 5 minutes | - | Process new memories with semantic context |
| **Daily Consolidation** | Daily | 2:00 AM | Consolidate day's memories into insights |
| **Weekly Patterns** | Weekly (Sunday) | 3:00 AM | Identify patterns and generate recommendations |
| **Knowledge Synthesis** | Monthly (1st) | 4:00 AM | Build knowledge nodes and graph |
| **Wisdom Extraction** | Quarterly | 5:00 AM | Extract principles and lessons learned |

## üîß Service Management

### Control Commands

```bash
# Install service
./scripts/service-control.sh install

# Start/stop/restart
./scripts/service-control.sh start
./scripts/service-control.sh stop
./scripts/service-control.sh restart

# Check status
./scripts/service-control.sh status

# View logs
./scripts/service-control.sh logs

# Uninstall service
./scripts/service-control.sh uninstall
```

### Run Tasks Manually

You can also run specific tasks on-demand:

```bash
# Process queue immediately
./scripts/service-control.sh run queue

# Run daily consolidation for yesterday
./scripts/service-control.sh run daily

# Run weekly pattern recognition
./scripts/service-control.sh run weekly

# Run knowledge synthesis
./scripts/service-control.sh run knowledge

# Extract wisdom
./scripts/service-control.sh run wisdom
```

## üîç Using the Enhanced Query Interface

The new query interface intelligently searches across all memory levels:

```python
from src.memory.query.enhanced_search import EnhancedQueryInterface

query = EnhancedQueryInterface()

# Examples:
results = query.query("What tasks do I have?")           # Searches actionable items
results = query.query("Show patterns from last week")    # Searches weekly patterns
results = query.query("What have I learned?")            # Searches wisdom/principles
results = query.query("Interactions with Sarah")         # Searches people-related memories
results = query.query("What did I do yesterday?")        # Searches daily consolidations
```

## üìä Database Schema Updates

The following consolidation tables have been added:

- `daily_consolidations` - Daily summaries and insights
- `weekly_patterns` - Weekly patterns and recommendations
- `knowledge_nodes` - Synthesized knowledge topics
- `knowledge_edges` - Relationships between knowledge nodes
- `wisdom` - Extracted principles and heuristics

The `memories` table has been extended with:
- `actionable` - Whether memory contains a task
- `urgency` - Task priority level
- `completed` - Task completion status
- `connections` - Related memory IDs

## üéØ Key Features

### Automatic Task Detection
- Tasks are detected during background processing
- No need to explicitly mark something as a task
- Urgency levels assigned automatically
- Task completions detected from context

### Semantic Understanding
- Every memory is processed with context from related memories
- Relationships are built automatically
- Similar tasks are grouped and updated

### Multi-Level Consolidation
- Raw memories ‚Üí Daily insights ‚Üí Weekly patterns ‚Üí Knowledge ‚Üí Wisdom
- Each level provides different perspectives
- Details fade while insights strengthen over time

### Emergent Structure
- No rigid schemas forced at input time
- Structure emerges from patterns
- System learns your personal patterns over time

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Service Won't Start
```bash
# Check logs
tail -f ~/.memory/logs/service-stderr.log

# Try running manually to see errors
python -m src.memory.service.scheduler
```

### Database Errors
```bash
# Check database integrity
sqlite3 ~/.memory/memories.db "PRAGMA integrity_check"

# Rebuild FTS index if needed
python -c "from src.memory.storage import Database; db = Database(); db.sync_fts()"
```

### Missing Dependencies
```bash
# Ensure all dependencies are installed
pip install schedule scikit-learn ollama chromadb
```

## üìà What Happens Next

With the service running, your memory system will:

1. **Continuously process** new memories every 5 minutes
2. **Build understanding** by finding connections and patterns
3. **Consolidate daily** to capture what matters from each day
4. **Recognize patterns** weekly to surface trends
5. **Synthesize knowledge** monthly from clustered memories
6. **Extract wisdom** quarterly from consistent patterns

All of this happens **automatically in the background** - you just keep adding memories as usual, and the system builds increasingly valuable insights over time.

## üéâ Success!

Your second brain now has a complete memory consolidation system that:
- ‚úÖ Runs everything async in the background
- ‚úÖ Detects tasks and actionables automatically
- ‚úÖ Consolidates at multiple time horizons
- ‚úÖ Builds knowledge and extracts wisdom
- ‚úÖ Provides intelligent multi-level search
- ‚úÖ Gets smarter the more you use it

The system is now ready to help you build a lasting, intelligent memory augmentation system that truly learns and grows with you!
