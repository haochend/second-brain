   - What behaviors or thoughts were unusual compared to normal?
   - What patterns repeated from previous days?
   - What new patterns emerged?

3. ACTIONABLE INTELLIGENCE
   - What specific actions should be taken tomorrow based on today?
   - What decisions need to be made?
   - What follow-ups are required?

4. KNOWLEDGE GAPS
   - What topics came up repeatedly that I don't fully understand?

1. INVISIBLE PATTERNS

2. ALIGNMENT CHECK
   - Where are my actions misaligned with my stated goals?
   - What am I saying vs what am I doing?
   - What intentions didn't translate to action?

3. LEVERAGE POINTS
   - What 1-2 changes would have the biggest positive impact?
   - What's the root cause behind multiple surface issues?
   - What's working well that I should do more of?

4. STRATEGIC QUESTIONS
   - What questions should I be asking but aren't?

2. LEARNING & GROWTH
   - What have I learned that changes how I approach things?
   - Where have I grown? Where have I stagnated?
   - What experiments worked? What failed? Why?

3. SYSTEM-LEVEL INSIGHTS
   - What systems or processes need redesigning?
   - What recurring problems have systemic causes?
   - What would an outside observer say about my patterns?

4. FORWARD LOOKING
   - Based on trends, what's likely to happen next month?

- Suggest 2-3 specific behavioral experiments

- What data is missing to reach conclusions?

EXPERIMENTS:
